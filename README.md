According to the MayoClinic (link above), "Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs." People with Pneumonia experience caughing, extreme phlegm, fever, difficulty breathing, and chills. Pneumonia, like many other illness, is very uncomfortable. Using neural networks modeling once can classify an image of a healthy lung compared to the image of a lung of a Pneumonia patient. This way the doctor can learn more about the disease to correctly classify patients as having Pneumonia or not having Pneumonia.
